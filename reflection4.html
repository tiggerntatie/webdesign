<h1>Web Design Reflection 4: Your Wish List?</h1>
<p>
  Last week I asked you to think about your ideas for a final project web site to work on during 
  the second quarter. This week I would like you to think about what you need to make your ideas 
  come to life.  Specifically, as you think back on what you have learned so far, do you think 
  you have picked up the skills and knowledge that you (and your partner) will need to execute 
  your ideas?
</p>
<p>
  I will use this reflection's results to <em>help</em> guide the course curriculum for the remainder of
  the second quarter.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a web page in your <code>public</code> folder and name it 
    <code>reflection04.html</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please answer the following questions in your page: 
    <ul>
      <li>What is the most important feature of your (planned) site that you have no idea how to
         create? Describe the feature with thorough detail!
      </li>
      <li>
        Find an existing web site (or sites) that also have this feature, or one similar to it. Include
        a link to this site in your reflection. Describe the feature on this other site so that
        I will be able to find it.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you can identify the specific skill or knowledge that you lack for implementing this 
        feature, please tell me about it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inspect the source of the existing web site. Can you find the section of HTML that
        is important for this feature?
      </li>
      <li>
        If you would like to, repeat these steps for any additional features that you think
        will present a problem.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Your reflection web page should validate (of course!).
  </li>
</ol>
