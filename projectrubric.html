                  Credit and URL for all images that you did not create. Do not provide a google
                  search URL. Make a reasonable effort to identify the author/artist responsible
                  or indicate that it is no longer covered by copyright (i.e. for very old images).

                  If an image is very important to your site (e.g. the site logo, page
                  background, etc.) you must obtain explicit permission from the author.

              <li>
                  If you use multiple images from one author or source, you must obtain explicit permission
                  from the author to use those images on your site. <strong>2%</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Your HTML and CSS must validate. I may make an exception for HTML or CSS provided by a
                  3rd party on a case by case basis. <strong>2%</strong>
              </li>
          </ul>
          (In all cases, an e-mail from a webmaster, or individual will be sufficient evidence of permission.)

               Author has paid attention to typeface size and style, color and background color or image,

               The visitor receives ample support and cues to help with navigating between pages on the

                site.<strong>1%</strong>

             <li>
                 All pages in the site are stylistically consistent with the home page. In other words,
                 is it obvious to the user that they are on YOUR site, no matter which page they are on?

             <li>
                 Site and page layouts respond well to different browser sizes (try resizing your browser
