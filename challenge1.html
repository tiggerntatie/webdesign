  <h1>Challenge 1: Bio and Goals</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Your web design &ldquo;biography&rdquo; and goals for the course.</p>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    This assignment is designed to get your feet wet with the lab computers, 
    show me that you can get around the Internet, and tell me more 
    about your experience and interest in &ldquo;web design&rdquo;.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignment</h2>
  <p>
    For your first assignment in Web Design, you will create your own web
    page on the Internet. This might seem odd, seeing as how you are enrolled
    in a so-called &ldquo;web design&rdquo; course! The fact is, there are 
    many tools and web sites that make it really easy to create your own
    web sites and pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are the things you have to do for the assignment:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your school gmail account. Click the <strong>Sites</strong> link
    at the top of the page and follow the instructions for creating your own site
    with at least one web page.</li>
    <li>On the main or home page of your site, write about the following:
      <ul>
        <li>What has been your experience, if any, with creating web sites or pages.</li>
        <li>What was your reason for taking the Web Design course (be honest!)?</li>
        <li>What would you like to get out of this course?</li>
        <li>What is an example of a web site or page that you admire? Why?</li>
        <li>What is an example of a web site or page that you hate? Why?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Get creative with the web site design.</em> Play around with it!</li>
    <li>Using your school e-mail account, send me an e-mail with a link to your new web page.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Due Date</h2>
  <p>
    This assignment is due by the end of school on Friday, September 2. You will be able to work
    on it during the X and in class on Friday.
