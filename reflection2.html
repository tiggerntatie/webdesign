<h1>Web Design Reflection 2: Think About Navigation</h1>
<p class="surprise">
  Most web sites that consist of more than a single page have a home page (like your 
  <code>index.html</code>) that visitors see first. A good home page should help your visitors
  find the information that they want as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, most home 
  pages have some kind of navigation design that helps visitors access any page in the site
  with relatively few clicks.
</p>
<p class="surprise">
  Please visit again your most and least favorite web sites and look at how the site navigation
  design works. Find and visit a THIRD site that has an unusual navigation design (you may want
  Google to help you with this). Web designers LOVE to collect unusual ideas for site navigation.
  Answer these questions about each of the <strong>three</strong> sites:
</p>
<ol class="surprise">
  <li>Does the site have a navigation system?</li>
  <li>Describe the location of the navigation bar or menu. At the top, bottom, sprawled
  across the middle are possible answers.</li>
  <li>How does the navigation system work? What does the user have to do to find a particular
  page at the site?</li>
  <li>Is the navigation system easy to understand and use? Please <strong>explain</strong> why!</li>
</ol>
<p class="surprise">
For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="surprise">
  The <a href="http://hanoverhigh.us">Hanover High web site</a> has a navigation system. The navigation 
  system is a vertical list of links at the left hand side of the page.
  To use the system, hover the mouse over an item and wait for a sub-menu of clickable 
  links will pop up over the page. I find these menus easy to understand but difficult to navigate 
  because if my mouse
  cursor slips off the original item as I move to the sub-menu, then a different sub-menu might be 
  displayed
  instead. It usually takes me two or three tries to navigate where I want to go. 
  </p>
</blockquote>

  As before, this reflection must be written as a web page. Please name the file <code>reflection02.html</code>
  and place it in the <code>public</code> directory on the web server. Although it is not 
  required, this would be a great time to practice styling a web page, or using tables in your
  HTML. <strong>Don't forget: 
    </strong> make sure your reflection validates. Feel free to add the
    <a href="http://netdenizen.org/webdesign/minitutorials/addvalidator.html">validation link/image</a>
      that you added in <a href="http://netdenizen.org/webdesign/challenge3.html">
      Challenge 3</a>.

  You may research and respond to this reflection as homework and use class time and/or the X
  to compose your answer using TextWrangler. You may also use <a href="http://shiftedit.net">
  shiftedit.net</a> to create and edit the page from home. This reflection is due on the next
  X day.
