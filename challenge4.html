  <h1>Challenge 4: Create your Web Design Homepage</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Use HTML to write a homepage for your experience with web design.</p>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    This assignment builds your fluency with HTML by continuing your practice with anchors (links)
    lists and tables. You will learn about different types of images used for web pages, when 
    to use them and whether to use them in your HTML or in CSS. You will continue to practice 
    styling your web pages with additional techniques for tables.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignment</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you have a couple of challenge assignments completed it would be nice to have a 
    single homepage that tells the world a little bit about you and your interests and links
    to your work for this course. For the purpose of this challenge, I will require you to add
    several elements to the page, but in the future you should customize it any way you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this assignment, tell me again about your experience and/or interest in web design (if
    any). As in Challenge 1, you must list your most and least favorite web pages or sites. This
    time, however, you will do this with a styled table. For example:
  </p>
  <table>
    <caption>Web sites that move me.</caption>
    <tr>
      <th>Site Name</th><th>Love or Hate?</th><th>Reason</th><th>Screenshot</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></td>
      <td>Love it!</td>
      <td>Everything is there, all the time, at my fingertips.</td>
      <td><img src="pictures/google-150.png" alt="Screenshot of the google.com homepage"
        width="150" height="90" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/">ENSI</a></td>
      <td>Eww</td>
      <td>The 90s called and wants its web site back!</td>
      <td><img src="pictures/ensi-150.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the ENSI-web homepage"
        width="150" height="109" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    Include at least 6 links in your page. Four of those could be links to the last three
    challenges you completed and two could be to the web sites you like and hate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are the things you will have to do for the assignment:
  </p>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>Using TextWrangler open a new SFTP browser (File/New/SFTP/FTP Browser), pick the
      netdenizen.org bookmark (or connect anew to netdenizen.org) to connect, then click the 
      New... button and name a new file <code>index.html</code> - <strong> this exact name is
      important!</strong> This will be the file you will use for the challenge.
    </li>
    <li>Your page must have a table similar to the example above for listing the web sites
      you love and hate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your page must have at least two images <em>that are relevant to what you are saying</em>.
      Use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element for this. You don't necessarily have to include
      the screen shots like the example above. Pictures of yourself? Favorite pets? Just make
      sure that they support what you are trying to say in some way (ex: &ldquo;This is a picture of
      me when I am designing web sites. This is a picture of my fluffy rabbit. A good web site
      is like a fluffy rabbit, because it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.&rdquo;) <strong>Do not 
      just link to photographs or images on other web sites!</strong>. You may download and 
      use public domain images, provided you give proper credit. You should take and use your
      own photographs for this challenge. Upload photographs to the web server using an FTP 
      tool such as <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a>, which is free and available
      for Macs and Windows PCs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your page must have a background image that enhances the style of the site, using the 
      CSS <code>background-image</code> attribute of the body.
    </li>
    <li>Your page must have links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements) to your existing challenge
      assignments and to the web sites you love and hate. If you decide to simply list the 
      links to your other assignments then you should use the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element
      to make an unordered list. <strong>Any</strong> time you find yourself making a list of
      something, you should probably use one of the list types supported in HTML.
    </li>
    <li>Your page must be styled using an external CSS file (similar to the last challenge).
      Your CSS file should be named <code>challenge04.css</code>
      You must use CSS to style the table, but you should style other parts of the page to 
      suit the overall look you would like.
    </li>
    <li>Add &ldquo;Valid&rdquo; icons for XHTML 1.1 and CSS to the bottom of your page.</li>
    <li>Your HTML and CSS should validate with no errors or warnings.</li>
  </ol>
