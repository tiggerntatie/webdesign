<h1>Web Design Reflection 5: Q1 Course Evaluation</h1>
<p>
  We have one more week in the first quarter! You have now been exposed to all of the major 
  technologies and techniques used in web design today. You can create a valid web page from 
  scratch, coded by hand, that is correct and attractive. You can style your page with CSS. You can
  merge Javascript and PHP code with your pages and make them do something useful. I am impressed
  with your persistence and creativity!
</p>
<p>
 Since this course is new for me, I am interested in gathering more than the usual amount of 
 feedback from my students about their experience with the course. I usually run a completely
 anonymous web survey, but since the class is relatively small it is unclear how anonymous that
 could really be. This course evaluation survey is NOT anonymous, but I hope you will feel free
 to tell me what is on your mind.

<ol class="instructions">
  <li>
    Create a web page in your <code>public</code> folder and name it 
    <code>reflection05.html</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please answer the following questions in your page, using complete, spell checked sentences: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        How would you describe the pace of the course so far? Do you wish I could have moved 
        faster or done more with each challenge? Do you think I expected too much, too fast?
      </li>
      <li>
        Did you feel the need to work outside of class? If so, were you able to?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do you think I should design the course to require more work outside of class, or should
        everything be accomplished during the classes?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do you think my grading has been fair and consistent? Is there anything I should do
        differently?
      </li>
      <li>
        What do you think about the weekly challenges. Are they too big? Too small? 
      </li>
      <li>
        My plan is to stop the weekly challenges soon and switch to longer term projects that you
        will select and plan for. How do you feel about the new phase? Do you wish we could 
        continue with weekly challenges, or are you ready for something bigger?
      </li>
      <li>
        The biggest surprise for me in this class is:

        The best thing about this class is:

        The worst thing about this class is:

      <li>
        Do you have any other comments or suggestions?
      </li>
    </ul>
      
  </li>
  <li>
    Your reflection web page should validate (of course!).
