<h1>Web Design Reflection 3: Think About A Project</h1>
<p>
Now that you have some experience writing web pages and uploading files to a web server, you should
know that you have developed core skills needed to be a professional web developer or designer. We 
have several more important topics to explore, but in the mean time this is a good time to 
<em>start</em> thinking about where you want to go during the second half of the course.
</p>
<p>
During the second quarter, you (and your partner) will design and create a full web site devoted 
to something that you are both interested in. For this reflection you will:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a web page in your <code>public</code> folder and name it 
    <code>reflection03.html</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In your page, present an idea for a web site that
    you would like to develop. You should include:
    <ul>
      <li>A possible name for the site.</li>
      <li>Will it be a site with information? Selling something? Promoting a cause? What?</li>
      <li>Are there other sites like it out there? What would set yours apart?</li>
      <li>Describe the look and feel of the site. Is there another site you would like to 
        emulate?
      </li>
      <li>
        Discuss your idea with a potential partner. What is his/her reaction?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Your reflection web page should validate (of course!).
  </li>
</ol>
