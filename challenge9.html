    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      It's time to show us what you've got! Redesign the <a href="http://hanoverhigh.us">Hanover High 
      School home page</a> using only CSS.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      You are now fairly competent HTML/CSS coders, but what if you had to work only in CSS? 
      In this challenge you will let your CSS skills shine by redesigning the Hanover High
      School home page using only CSS. This will also be an opportunity to play with a more
      sophisticated navigation menu and look at clever tricks for styling element backgrounds 
      for interesting design effects.

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      The web didn't always depend on the two pillars of web design: HTML and CSS.  Once upon a time
      everything was written using HTML alone! Style information was embedded in the HTML elements
      themselves, and changing the style or appearance of a web page was very inconvenient
      once it had been completely written.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 2000s a web site appeared that demonstrated the promising marriage of CSS and
      HTML like nothing else before: <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>. The
      Zen Garden was a single page web site that allowed the visitor to select from a variety of
      user-contributed CSS files. Although each CSS file made the web page look completely different, 
      the underlying HTML file was never altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS Zen Garden's mission has been accomplished and today it no longer accepts submissions
      of new CSS files. In Challenge 9 you will borrow the CSS Zen Garden concept and create
      a CSS file <strong>only</strong> that will style the Hanover High School home page.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this challenge I have <a href="./hhsindex.html">
      recreated the HHS home page</a> as a simple HTML page with numerous
      <code>&lt;div></code> blocks, section titles and all of the original navigation links. I have
      left out all images that do not semantically enrich the site. I have removed all styling
      information from the page. Your new HHS homepage consists of 9578 characters, compared
      with the original HHS page that has 26378 characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have placed a link to the new HHS homepage HTML in your public folder. You can not 
      edit this file. It also pulls in a file called <code>challenge09.css</code> which does
      <strong>not</strong> exist in your public folder. You must create this CSS file and 
      edit it to make an awesome looking HHS home page!
    </p>

    <ol class="instructions">
      <li>Create a new file on the server: <code>challenge09.css</code> - <strong> this exact name is
        important!</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Your CSS must validate with no errors or warnings. I have already taken care of the 
        HTML validation!
      </li>
      <li>There is no third requirement! I will not limit your imagination by giving you a laundry
        list of tasks to perform. You have until Friday to do the best possible job!
