    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      It's time to do your own thing! Imagine a web site and make it happen.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      People learn best by <em>doing</em>. For the rest of the semester you will be working on
      building a complete web site with multiple pages. While you do this you will have plenty
      of time to hone the skills you have developed and pick up new ones at the same time.
    </p>
      <h2>Due Date</h2>
      <p>
        Your project proposal is due on Tuesday, November 8, 2011.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class='main'>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      During the first quarter you have worked hard to learn the basics of XHTML for page coding
      and CSS for page styling. You have even gone face to face with computer languages: Javascript
      and PHP. Altogether you have spent approximately as much time on this as you would have if you
      just completed your first full week as a novice web designer. Since you have what is 
      effectively almost a <em>second</em> full week available (if we include x-days), you have enough 
      time to put together a significant web site with several (five or more) linked pages. 
    </p>
    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
    <p>
      I have collected a short list of general project ideas to help you brainstorm:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a site for a friend's rock band (real or imaginary)</li>
      <li>Promote a fake movie, product, or computer game</li>
      <li>Promote your home town as a travel destination</li>
      <li>Presidential campaign site for a campaign from long ago (Abraham Lincoln?)</li>
      <li>Promote a fictional public works project (a subway system for Hanover?)</li>
      <li>Promote your favorite hobby (taxidermy?)</li>
      <li>Promote your favorite sport or team (think local)</li>
      <li>Find a non-profit organization in need of a web site</li>
      <li>A home page for your church group?</li>
      <li>Redesign the HHS web site (this time with CSS <strong>and</strong> HTML!)</li>
      <li>Promote a fictional hobby (bonsai kittens?)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      You have some experience with Javascript and PHP, but not enough to do anything big, so keep
      that in mind if you start to think about creating a site with <em>dynamic</em> content. There
      are also lots of places where you can download scripts for free, if you don't want to 
      reinvent the wheel.
    </p>

    <h2>Here is what you need to do:</h2>

    <ul class="instructions">
      <li>Think about the project you would like to attempt. You can work with a partner, but there
        can be no more than two people on a team. You will have to agree to receive the same 
        grade for the proposal, all weekly updates and the final project itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your project will need a name. Actually, two names: one name will be what your visitors will
        see (for example: &ldquo;When Pigs Fly!&rdquo;) and the other will become the directory
        name on your account where the project will be found (for example: <code>whenpigsfly</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are working with a partner, one of you will host the site on his/her account. Figure
        out who this <strong>owner</strong> will be. Keep in mind that both partners will need to 
        log in to that account to edit files.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you're ready, tell me about the project the project owner and who is on the team.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will need to create a project proposal web page. The proposal will stand as your
        formal description of what you intend to create (after all, you can't attain your goals
        if you don't know what they are!):
        <ol>
          <li>On the project owner's account, 
            create a <strong>sub-directory</strong> in the public folder, with the short name that you
            decided on above (for example: create a sub-directory called <code>whenpigsfly</code> in the
            <code>public</code> directory).
          </li>
          <li>
            Create another subdirectory called <code>plan</code> inside the directory you created
            above (for example: you would have a sub-directory called <code>plan</code> in the
            <code>public/whenpigsfly/</code> directory).
          </li>
          <li>
            Create your proposal file, named <code>index.html</code> inside the <code>plan</code>
            folder that you created above (for example: you would have a file called 
            <code>public/whenpigsfly/plan/index.html</code>. If you need help with these steps, talk to me!
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Your proposal should contain the following information:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Project name (long version).
          </li>
          <li>
            Project name (short version).
          </li>
          <li>
            Team member names
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>clickable</strong> link to the landing or home page for your project 
            (for example: <a href="www.netdenizen.org/u/ericd/whenpigsfly">when pigs fly</a>). The 
            landing page should be named <code>index.html</code> so it will be loaded automatically
            if someone points their browser to your project (that is, they don't have to know the
            name of your page).
          </li>
          <li>
            A paragraph describing the proposed web site. Don't just say &ldquo;A web site about
            art&rdquo;. There are lots of web sites about art. What makes your web site different?
          </li>
          <li>
            A paragraph for each page (including the landing page) that you are planning for the 
            site, describing the purpose of the page. Be sure to mention any features of these
            pages that you do not already know how to create (that is, try to figure out what
            you will need to learn to do for each page). 
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Your proposal must validate with no errors or warnings (of course!).
      </li>
    </ul>
