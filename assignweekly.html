    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Make a plan for the coming week. When the week is over, how did you do?
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Every project needs to be broken down into smaller chunks of work that can be accomplished
      in short periods of time. You will write a project plan for each week during this project
      and then follow up with a summary of how well you managed to meet your plan.
    </p>
      <h2>Due Date</h2>
      <p>
        Your plan will be due (generally) on Fridays. Your report on what you accomplished on
        the plan will be due (generally) on the following Thursdays.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class='main'>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      With your partner (if you have one), figure out what seems reasonable to accomplish during 
      the week to come. These goals need to be verifiable in some way. For example a goal that 
      says, &ldquo;Improve the appearance of the contact page&rdquo; is too vague: how would you
      or someone else look at the page and decide if the goal has been met? A better goal requires
      that you identify the <strong>specific</strong> shortcomings of the contact page: list 
      those shortcomings and state which ones will be corrected by the end of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the week is over (on the following Thursday), you (and your partner) should review
      your plan and update each item with a note about whether it has been completed or not. 
      For example, your original plan might look like this:
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Things to do this week</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a gallery page</li>
        <li>Gallery page will have a collection of photographs, arranged in a 3x4 grid</li>
        <li>Gallery photos will each have a description or caption</li>
        <li>Gallery page will have same visual theme as the site, but the background image will have
          lots of pictures of cameras on it.</li>
        <li>Add driving directions to the contact page</li>
        <li>Correct spelling and grammatical errors on the index.html page</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      A week later you would edit your plan to make it look like this:
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Things to do this week</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a gallery page <strong>created page named: gallery.html</strong></li>
        <li>Gallery page will have a collection of photographs, arranged in a 3x4 grid 
          <strong>wrote html and styled in css to arrange photographs in grid.</strong></li>
        <li>Gallery photos will each have a description or caption <strong>captions added</strong></li>
        <li>Gallery page will have same visual theme as the site, but the background image will have
          lots of pictures of cameras on it. <strong>Did this, but it looked really stupid so we
          changed our minds and took it back out.</strong></li>
        <li>Add driving directions to the contact page <strong>linked to google directions page 
          instead</strong></li>
        <li>Correct spelling and grammatical errors on the index.html page <strong>fixed with
          spell check</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Here is what you need to do:</h2>

    <ul class="instructions">
      <li>
        For Weekly #1, create a file named <code>weekly01.html</code> <strong>in your plan
        folder</strong>. The name and location are important! For Weekly #2, use the name <code>
        weekly02.html</code> (get the idea?)
      </li>
      <li>
        The page title should indicate your project name and which weekly this is (i.e. 1, 2, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        A simple unordered list of goals for the week should follow (see the example above). If you
        have unfinished goals from the previous week, you can put them back in the next
        week's plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a week (typically on Thursday), reopen the plan in Textwrangler and update
        each item with current status of work on that item.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your weekly plan must validate with no errors or warnings (of course!).
      </li>
    </ul>
