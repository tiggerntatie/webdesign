<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Web Design is a one semester course that will provide you with the basic skills you need to 
  develop web sites using a variety of techniques (HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript). During the first 
  half of the semester you will focus on developing skills and will 
  complete weekly challenge assignments. During the second half of the semester you will work in 
  teams to produce a web site.
</p>
<p>
  Some portion of each class will be devoted to introducing skills or techniques you need to 
  complete the weekly challenge, or to support your final project. The remaining class time is 
  available for you to work on the challenges or project. 
</p>
<p>
  This class has an X period on Thursday. Please check in at the start of class (or make 
  arrangements with me in advance). I do take and submit attendance for the X! The X is available 
  to you for finishing your work, getting help or completing missed quizzes. 
</p>

<h2>I Provide You With:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Computers with Internet access.</li>
  <li>Web development software (Textwrangler and Cyberduck).</li>
  <li>Internet web hosting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>You May Need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you would like to work on your projects outside of class, a USB Flash drive 
    may come in handy.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you would like to work outside of class you may use a free, online web development 
    application (I recommend <a href="http://shiftedit.net">ShiftEdit</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    If you would like to use your personal computer, make sure all web browsers are updated 
    to the latest versions (I especially recommend 
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> or 
    <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> for web development).
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>I Expect YOU To:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Come to class. Unexcused absences receive no credit for missed work.</li>
    <li>Be on time. Please let me know if you expect to be late.</li>
    <li>
      Be responsible. If you are absent on a day when work is due you are expected to have 
      it ready the day you return. If you know you will not be able to take a test or quiz at 
      the scheduled time make arrangements with me (by e-mail, in person, etc.) and receive 
      confirmation before the scheduled class.
    </li>
    <li>Always treat others with kindness and respect.</li>
  </ul>

<table>
  <caption>Homework, Quizzes and Project Grading</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Weekly Challenges</th>
    <td>
      Each challenge requires you to produce a web page or pages that demonstrates competence 
      in some aspect(s) of the web design process. You may collaborate with other students 
      and scour the Internet for ideas. Please let me know who you worked with and list any 
      web sites or references that inspired you. Challenges must typically be completed 
      on Friday.  Scoring rubric:
      <ul>
        <li>0/10 - Not submitted</li>
        <li>5/10 - Work submitted, but ignores most objectives.</li>
        <li>6/10 - Page validates but few objectives met <strong>or</strong> many validation errors</li>
        <li>7/10 - Page validates and some objectives met <strong>or</strong> page has validation errors for no good reason</li>
        <li>8/10 - Page validates and most objectives met <strong>or</strong> page only has unavoidable errors, if any</li>
        <li>9/10 - Page validates with warnings and all objectives met</li>
        <li>10/10 - All objectives met and validates without warnings or errors</li>
        <li>11/10 - Extra Credit awarded for exceptional work</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Weekly Reflections</th>
    <td>
      You will be prompted to research web sites and/or think about some element of the design
      process and comment.
      These will typically be assigned Friday or Monday and will be due on Fridays. Reflections
      are graded on a 10 point scale, with -1 point for late submissions, -1 point for pages
      that do not validate (<a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a>) and -1 point
      for pages that do not respond to the prompt.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Quizzes</th>
    <td>
      Every two weeks or so, you will be quizzed on some of the techniques used in the 
      challenge assignments. Quizzes will usually consist of creating a web page during 
      class and will be “open Internet”. Each quiz will list several requirements and each requirement
      is scored as one or two points.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Project Reviews</th>
    <td>
      Your final web site project will require planning. Your team must develop a plan and 
      demonstrate weekly progress towards completion. A well-designed and implemented web 
      site represents a substantial amount of work!
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Final Project (Web Site)</th>
    <td>This will be the “final exam” for the course.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Late Work</th>
    <td>
      All work is subject to being graded once the due date has arrived. Work that is completed
      <em>or revised</em> after the due date, may be awarded full credit within two weeks of the 
      original due date. <strong>You must inform me by e-mail of updated pages or any time you 
      submit late work, as I have no way of knowing what you want me to look at!</strong>
