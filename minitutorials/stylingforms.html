<h1>Styling Forms and Form Elements</h1>
<p>
  If you follow the advice in the mini-tutorial on 
  <a href="./minitutorials/forms.html">
  HTML forms</a> then you will end up with a fairly ugly looking web form, including bullets on 
  each line (because you should put form elements into a list). Putting form controls into an
  HTML list may seem like a crazy thing, but it makes some sense. Form controls are <em>inline</em>
  elements, which means that if you just put a bunch of them into a paragraph then they will string
  themselves out from left to right, wrapping around at the end of the line. Most web forms aren't
  arranged like that, as the usual style is to stack the controls on top of each other, or possibly
  in a couple of columns. An HTML list is a great device for forcing a collection of <em>things</em>
  to appear in a stacked list, even if you don't want it to be a true bulleted list. 
</p>
<p>
  Let's examine some basic styling that we need to make these things look nice:
</p>
<h2>Styling Containing List</h2>
<p>
  First of all, we don't want this list of controls to look like a bulleted list. For this, we 
  could use this rule in CSS:
</p>
<pre><code>
ul.form {
  padding: 0;             /* none of the lefthand whitespace that a list usually has */
  list-style-type: none;  /* no bullets, please */
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This rule will take effect on every <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element with <code>class='form'</code>
  and leave every other <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> alone. Padding is set to zero, which will remove
  the customary left-hand white space of a list. The <code>list-style-type</code> attribute is used
  with value <code>none</code> to remove the bullets from the list. Now the list just appears like
  a row of lines without any decoration.
</p>
<h2>Styling Each Line</h2>
<p>
  Within the list of controls, each line is styled using the following rule:
</p>
<pre><code>
ul.form li {
  clear: both;        /* each li is fully below one before */
  padding: 0.2em;     /* space each item in the list */
  margin: 0.2em;      
  overflow: auto;     /* expand to enclose all blocks inside */
  background-color: #fafafa;  /* group each row, visually */
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Because <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements are blocks, they can be styled using float and clear, 
  just like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. The first attribute, <code>clear: both;</code>, forces
  each line to sit completely below the previous line. Padding and margin are set to enforce a
  comfortable moat around our form controls. <code>overflow: auto;</code> forces each line in the
  list to expand vertically to encompass everything it contains. Without this, the contents of 
  each line overflow their lower vertical bounds. The final <code>background-color</code> attribute
  adds a faint background to each line. The <code>margin</code> set earlier will leave white space
  around each line's background coloring. You should feel free to experiment with all of these
  attributes in your own forms.
</p>
<h2>Styling the Labels</h2>
<p>
  The general pattern for web controls is to have a control <em>label</em> to the left of the 
  control to tell you what to put in the text box (e.g. 'Last Name'). We want all of these 
  to be on the left-hand edge of each line of the list. We can do this by forcing each label
  that has <code>class='label'</code> to be a block and float it to the left:
</p>
<pre><code>
ul.form .label {
  display: block;     /* each label works like a block, */
  float: left;        /* and floated to the left */
  width: 30%;         /* uniform column width */
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  First of all, the <em>selector</em> of this rule is <code>ul.form .label</code>, which means
  that the rule will affect every element with <code>class='label'</code> that is a child
  (that is, nested inside) of a <code>ul.form</code> element (an unordered list with 
  <code>class='form'</code>). When selectors are spaced like this, it makes your specification 
  more narrow and precise. The width attribute will make every label with this class fit inside
  a block that is 30% of the width of the containing block (that is, 30% of the list width).
</p>

<h2>Styling the Controls</h2>
<p>
  Now that the labels are lined up, we can drop the controls down on their right hand side using
  this piece of CSS:
</p>
<pre><code>
ul.form li .input {
  display: block;    /* each collection of inputs works like a block, */
  float: left;       /* and floated to the left */
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This is similar to the label styling rule, and it is applied to everything that is defined
  with <code>class='input'</code> in the HTML. Usually this is applied to any <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
  elements, but for some (radio buttons, for example) it is applied to an enclosing 
  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. As always, study the assignment 6
