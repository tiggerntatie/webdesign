<h1>Absolute Positioning and Other Tricks</h1>

<p>
  This tutorial describes a little trick for positioning blocks of text anywhere on the page.
  You should notice that this page has some white space above the title. In that white space 
  is a paragraph containing the validation links. Notice that it appears to precede all of the 
  rest of the text.
</p>

<p>
  Now look at the source for this page. Notice that the paragraph that appears in that floating block 
  is actually found at the very END of the file. Using CSS, the block has been pulled out of 
  the flow of the document and plopped down at the top of the page!
</p>

<h2>The CSS</h2>
<p>
  The CSS required to move this block is shown below. This is the actual bit of CSS used to style
  the page you are looking at now:
</p>
<pre><code>
h1 {
  margin-top: 150px;  /* this creates the big block of white space above the title! */
}

p.floater {
  padding: 1em;
  border: black solid 1px;
  background: blue;
  width: 200px;
  position: absolute; /* this means you want to position the block manually */
  left: 150px;  /* position relative to the left of the page (% or px or em) */
  top: 50px;     /* position relative to the top of the page (% or px or em) */
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  I have to warn you, though: positioning a block with the position:absolute attribute/value does
  not cause other text to flow around the block, the way it would if you had used float or clear.
  Once you start using absolute positioning you will be responsible for creating white space
  for your blocks to live in (which I did using the margin-top property of the h1 title). If you 
  don't create white space then your blocks will appear on top of or underneath the rest of the page.
  If you want a block to appear above another block you can use the z-index property in both 
  blocks, which controls how different parts of the text are stacked on top of each other. 
</p>

<h2>One More Thing</h2>
<p>
  (you might find useful...)
</p>
<p>
  If you have a block of text in your HTML that you would rather not have appearing in the web
  page itself you can simply use the following CSS to make it disappear:
</p>

<!-- THE FOLLOWING LINE DOES NOT APPEAR IN YOUR BROWSER. THANKS, CSS!!! -->
<h3 class="make-this-disappear">This header doesn't appear in the page!</h3>

<pre><code>
h3.make-this-disappear {
  display: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  Check out the source for this page to find the piece of the page that <strong>didn't</strong>
  end up appearing in print!
