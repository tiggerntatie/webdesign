<h1>How to add style to your page with CSS</h1>
<p>
  Up to this point your web pages have been clever and witty but without any distinctive style.
  To style your pages, you have to create a new file on the web server called a &ldquo;cascading 
  style sheet&rdquo;. Many web sites use a single file (often named <code>style.css</code>) for
  styling every web page on the site. This is efficient because once your visitor's web browser
  has downloaded the style sheet for the site, it never has to download it again. This helps your
  pages load FAST!
</p>
<p>
  Using your text editor, create a new file on the server called <code>challenge03.css</code>. You
  can set up an empty style sheet file by copying and pasting the following text into the new file:
</p>
<pre><code>
@charset "utf-8";
/* CSS Document */
</code></pre>
<p>
  You must also modify your web page HTML to include a <strong>link</strong> to the style sheet. 
  You can copy the following line of code into the <code>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</code> 
  section of your web page:
</p>
<pre><code>
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="challenge03.css" type="text/css" media="screen" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  If you were developing a large web site with multiple pages, you would probably create a 
  <em>single</em> style sheet (for example: <code>style.css</code>) and make every web page on 
  your site link to it instead of making a different style sheet for every page. The reason you 
  want a single style sheet is because your web site will probably have a common style or theme
  for all its pages. If you decide at a later date that you want to go for a different look, you
  need only modify the single style sheet and every page on the site will assume a new appearance!
</p>
<h2>Customizing your style sheet</h2>
<p>
  The basic idea in the style sheet is that you can override the default appearance of any tag
  on the web page. For example, if you want all text that appears in a heading to be sans-serif
  then you might add a section to your style sheet file that looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
h1, h2, h3, h4 {
  font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  With this in your style sheet every part of your web page that has an h1, h2, h3 or h4 tag
  will be displayed using the Verdana font. If your visitor's computer doesn't have Verdana
  installed, then it will display with Arial. In the amazing event that even Arial isn't available
  then the browser will use any sans-serif style font that it does have installed. 
  <strong>NOTE</strong>: every attribute inside the curly braces is written as <strong>attribute
  </strong> followed by colon (:), followed by one or more values, separated by commas, and ends
  with a <strong>semi-colon</strong>. The attributes are enclosed by the curly braces.
</p>
<p>
  You can change the style of <em>everything</em> in the document by customizing the <strong>body
  </strong> tag. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
body {
  font-family: georgia, helvetica, serif;
  color: #f00;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: italic;
  font-size: 1.5em;
  background: #00f
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This example includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>font-family: a list of typeface names, in <em>increasing</em> order of common-ness</li>
  <li>color: colors are specified with a # followed by three hexadecimal characters. Hexadecimal
  (hex for short) are numbers in base 16. If you were to count in hex, you would go like this: 
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, 10, 11, 12, 13, etc. The three hex digits
  correspond to <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong> and <strong>blue</strong>. A color
  written as #fff would be a combination of brightest red, green and blue, which would appear as white.
  A color written as #000 has no red, green or blue and would appear black. Mix and match the digits
  to invent your own cool colors.</li>
  <li>font-weight: can be <strong>bold</strong> or <strong>normal</strong> or just omit the 
  setting altogether if you want normal weight.</li>
  <li>font-style: can be <strong>italic</strong> or <strong>normal</strong> or just omit the
  setting altogether if you want a normal style.</li>
  <li>font-size: specifies the default height of your text, relative to the default for the browser. 1em; 
  would give you default-sized text. 2em; would give you text that is twice normal size. 0.5em; would 
  give you text that is half its normal size, and so on.</li>
  <li>background: specifies the background color of your web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can specify the style of your entire document by styling the <code>body</code> tag, then
  override that setting by specifying other styles for tags that fall inside the <code>body</code>
  tag.
</p>
<p>
  Use the style directives that I have include here as examples to get started, then try 
  playing around with the settings to achieve a unique style for <strong>your</strong> web page!
  Don't forget to look at the CSS files that were used to create web pages for this course. Check
  the link for viewing CSS at the bottom of the challenge03 web page to see an example of what 
  a CSS file might look like.
