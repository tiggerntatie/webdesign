<h1>PHP Form Basics</h1>
<p>
  In the minitutorial on <a href="./phpbasics.html">PHP Basics</a> you learned how to write a
  web page that has PHP scripting embedded in it. If you didn't actually try out the examples
  in that tutorial <strong>then I urge you to go back to it, read it, and try the examples</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will be looking at how your form is written to activate your PHP file, and
  exactly how the information in the form is passed in to the PHP file.
</p>
<h2>Posting data to your PHP script</h2>
<p>
  In this and the previous challenge, you have enclosed all of your form controls inside of a
  <code>&lt;form></code> element. There was a lot additional stuff inside that element that you
  haven't had to pay attention to before:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;form id="visitor-info-form" action="./challenge8.php" method="post">
</code></pre>
<p>
  The <code>action</code> attribute here lists a web address of the web page that will receive
  the posted form. When you write your own form and PHP file, <strong>you must change this URL to 
  point to your PHP file</strong>. If you forget and reuse the line from the challenge assignment 
  then your form will always be sent to the challenge8.php that was written for the assignment!
</p>
<p>
  All of the input controls in your form can be written pretty much the way they were for the last
  challenge, with the exception of the push button:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;input type='submit' value='Send' name='submit' />
</code></pre>
<p>
  Unlike the button in challenge 6, this button does not include an <code>onclick</code> 
  attribute. Instead, the default behavior of the button is to "submit" the contents of the entire
  form to the web address listed in the <code>action</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;form></code>
  element. The additional attributes in this <code>&lt;input></code> element are <code>value</code>,
  which sets the text that appears in the button image and <code>name</code> which determines
  how this button will be identified in the form data that are sent to the PHP page.
</p>
<h2>Receiving posted data at the web server</h2>
<p>
  As you recall from the <a href="./phpbasics.html">PHP Basics</a> page, you tell the web server
  that you want to insert scripting code in your PHP file by using the <code>&lt;?php</code>
  and <code>?></code> to begin and end the code section. Form entries are received in the
  PHP script in the form of a special array variable that looks like this (for example): 
  <code>$_POST['birth-month']</code>. In this example, the data originated in a form input element 
  that had an attrbute: <code>name='birth-month'</code>.
</p>
<p>
  I recommend converting all of the variables like: <code>$_POST['birth-month']</code> to
  ordinary variables, like this: <code>$birthmonth</code>. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
  /* Include some script code for setting variables equal to the form contents */
  $name = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['first-name']);
  $birthplace = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['birthplace']);
  $firstnumber = (float) $_POST['number1'];
  $secondnumber = (float) $_POST['number2'];
  $birthmonth = $_POST['birth-month'];
  $birthdecade = $_POST['birth-decade'];
  $comments = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['comments']);
}
?>
</code></pre>
<p>
  Let's look at each of these lines individually:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
</code></pre>
<p>
  This checks to see if one of the pieces of information coming from the other page is data from
  the submit button itself. If the server arrived at this page because the user typed it in to 
  the URL bar in the browser, then there will be no form data included. This line checks to see 
  if the page is being retrieved because someone pressed the submit button. If so, the following
  code (inside the {} brackets) will be executed.
</p>
<pre><code>
  $name = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['first-name']);
</code></pre>
<p>
  This does three things. First, the data are retrieved with <code>$_POST['first-name']</code>.
  Next, it is modified to make it safe to use in a database query with 
  <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code>. Finally, the result is saved to a variable called
  <code>$name</code>. It is "good practice" to save all of the form data that you are interested
  in using to variables like this.
</p>
<pre><code>
  $firstnumber = (float) $_POST['number1'];
</code></pre>
<p>
  This retrieves a form field called <code>number1</code> and converts it from text to a 
  floating point number using a cast: <code>(float)</code>. Lastly the numeric version of the text
  is stored in a variable called <code>$firstnumber</code>.
</p>
<p> 
  The <code>$birthmonth</code> and <code>$birthdecade</code> variables are not protected with
  the <code>mysql_real_escape_string</code> call because the values are set by the HTML itself.
  If you're not sure, you can safely use <code>mysql_real_escape_string</code> on every piece
  of data received by the PHP form.
</p>
<h2>Other processing you can do</h2>
<p>
  You can do other things than just regurgitation of submitted data. PHP is a useful math tool 
  because it can also perform mathematical operations on the data. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php

  if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
    $product = $firstnumber * $secondnumber;
    print("The product of your numbers is $product.");
  }
?>
</code></pre>
<p>
  This code will take the two numbers submitted with the form, multiply them together and 
  print the result directly to the web page where the visitor will see it.
