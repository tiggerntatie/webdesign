<h1>Styling Navigation Links with CSS</h1>
<p>
  Most web sites or pages have a list of important links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags) that help the reader
  find other pages on the site. Since it is merely a list of links, the preferred method of
  making this navigation list is with an HTML list such as <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. A navigation
  list like this might look something like:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="./index.html">Web Design Home&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="./calendar.html">Assignment Calendar&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="./studentwork">Student Work&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
</code></pre>
<p>
  Which looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./index.html">Web Design Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="./calendar.html">Assignment Calendar</a></li>
  <li><a href="./studentwork">Student Work</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  This gets the job done, but it looks awful. That is where CSS comes to the rescue!
</p>
<h2>CSS Attributes For Styling Lists of Links</h2>
<p>
  Instead of coding your links like the previous example, add a class attribute like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;ul class='navigation'>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="./index.html">Web Design Home&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="./calendar.html">Assignment Calendar&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="./studentwork">Student Work&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
</code></pre>
<p>
  Then the following CSS attributes could used to style <strong>only</strong> the links in a list
  that is marked with the <code>navigation</code> class:
</p>
<pre><code>
ul.navigation { 
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0.5em;                     /* a little space around the menu                               */
}

ul.navigation li {
  display: inline;                    /* turns a &lt;li&gt; into an inline tag, instead of a block     */
                                      /* this also gets rid of the bullets                             */
  background-color: #eee;             /* set it apart visually                                         */
  padding: 0.1em 0.3em 0.1em 0.3em;   /* give it some added bulk and size                              */
                                      /* these sizes are for top right bottom and left, respectively   */
}

ul.navigation a {
  text-decoration: none;              /* no underline for these links                                  */
  font-family: verdana, sans-serif;   /* a different font to set them apart from text                  */
}

ul.navigation li:hover {
  background-color: #ccc;             /* change the link background color when the user hovers         */
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  And the end result is this:
</p>
<ul class='navigation'>
  <li><a href="./index.html">Web Design Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="./calendar.html">Assignment Calendar</a></li>
  <li><a href="./studentwork">Student Work</a></li>
</ul>

<p class='one'>
  Let's talk about how this CSS works. Instead of just referring to the <code>
  &lt;ul&gt;</code> tag in each CSS block, it refers to <code>ul.navigation</code>. This means that the
  styling rule doesn't apply to just <strong>any</strong> <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag: it refers
  to <strong>only</strong> the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tags that have their <code>class</code>
  attribute set to <code>navigation</code>. Furthermore, when two tags are listed one after the 
  other with a space between them (ex. <code>ul.navigation li</code>) it means that you are
  styling every <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag that appears inside a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag
  with the <code>navigation</code> class.
</p>
<p class='two'>
  Go back up to the second HTML example and look at the snippet of code:
  The <code>&lt;ul class='navigation'></code> that begins the unordered list has an additional
  attribute, <code>class</code>, set equal to <code>navigation</code>. Now only <strong>this
  </strong> unordered list will have the special styling. Any ordinary list will just look like
  a simple list of bullet points.
</p>
<p class='three'>
  Notice that to use the class attribute in your CSS, you have to refer to the tag, followed by
  a period, then the name of the class that was set in the HTML. Pro-tip: don't name your classes
  in a way that suggests the style (that is, don't name a class 'bold' or 'big-font'). Your 
  class names should reflect the semantics of the content: it should suggest how this piece of
  the page is meaningfully different from everything else. In the example on this page I have used
  the class named <code>navigation</code>, which indicates the <em>purpose</em> of the list, but 
  nothing about its <em>appearance</em>.
</p>
<p class='four'>
  You can use class attributes to style other things. For example, in this document paragraphs
  can be styled according to four different rules. See how this paragraph looks different from the
  three that preceed it? That was done with class attribute styling. Look at the HTML and CSS
  for this page to see the details!
