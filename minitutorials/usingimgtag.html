<h1>How to use &lt;img&gt; tags</h1>
<p>
The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is used to insert an image (photograph, graphic, etc.) in your
web page. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag should <em>only</em> be used for adding images that
are relevant to the content of the page. Do <em>not</em> use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to
add images that are incidental to your content. Any image that is part of the style or look and
feel of the page should be added using CSS.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you were writing a page about the battleship Massachusetts, it would make sense
to have a photograph of the ship itself. Use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag for this. If your
page also has a background image consisting of an endless vista of white capped waves, to give
your page a salty nautical feel, then that image should be added using CSS, because it does
not add anything to the <em>information</em> on your page.
</p>
<p>
One way to understand the distinction is to ask yourself whether a blind person using a screen
reading program would need to know anything about the image. If the reader doesn't need to know
about the image to understand the article, then it should be added using CSS.
</p>

<h2>Using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Tag</h2>

<p>
Following is an example of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> in use:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;img src="pictures/google-150.png" 
     alt="Screenshot of the google.com homepage"
     width="150" height="90" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
There are a few things worth noticing about this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag does <strong>not</strong> have a closing 
    <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag. The tag itself is self closing: the ending <code>&gt;</code>
    is preceded by the <code>/</code> character. </li>
  <li>The <code>src</code> attribute is used to give URL of the image. If the image is stored
    in the same directory as the html file then just the image file name is needed. In the 
    example above, the image is <code>google-150.png</code> and it is stored in a directory
    named <code>pictures</code>. <strong>Do not ever use this URL to link to an image
    on a different web site, as it misrepresents ownership and is effectively stealing
    the other site's bandwidth.</strong></li>
  <li>The <code>alt</code> attribute is <em>required</em> with every image. If your reader is blind
    and reading your page using a screen reader, then they will hear the text that is included
    in quotations following the <code>alt</code>. This text should describe what is in the picture
    in a way that would make the picture meaningful to someone who is unable to see it.</li>
  <li>Always specify the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the image. This helps
    your reader's browser format the page on the screen <em>before</em> the image has been 
    received from the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>File Sizes and Formats</h2>
<p>
There are two image file formats commonly in use today: jpg (or jpeg) and png.
</p>
<p>
The jpeg format is a compressed image format is known as &ldquo;lossy&rdquo;. This means that
an image saved in jpeg format does <em>not</em> look exactly like the original. With photographs
the difference is not usually noticable unless the compression is extreme. When you use a 
piece of software like Photoshop to save a jpeg format file, it will ask you for a quality setting,
ranging from 1 to 10. Experiment with low quality (which means small file size and high compression)
to find a setting that is acceptable visually, while having a small file size. The smaller your
image files, the faster your page will load, and the more likely your visitor is to stick around
and read or buy something! Note: the jpeg format compression artifacs usually make logos or line
drawings look pretty ugly, so use png for them.
</p>
<p>
The png format is also a compressed image format, but is &ldquo;lossless&rdquo;. This means
that an image saved in png format <em>does</em> look exactly like the original and has no 
compression artifacts or visual defects. It does not compress as well as jpeg, so it is not
a good choice for photographs. The png format should be used for logos, line drawings or cartoon-
like graphics. Any image that you create with solid colors and/or sharp outlines should probably
be stored in the png format.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of which format you choose, be sure to resize and compress the image using a tool
like Photoshop <em>before</em> you upload it to the web server.
