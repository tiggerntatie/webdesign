<h1>PHP Scripting Basics</h1>
<p>
  PHP files are just like the HTML files you have been writing, with the single exception that 
  the server actually looks closely at their contents, and makes changes before sending the file
  off to the web browser. So, for example, you could have a basic PHP page that looks just like
  this:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
&lt;head>
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://netdenizen.org/webdesign/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />
  &lt;title>Empty PHP File&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
  &lt;p>Hello, web browser!&lt;/p>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</code></pre>
<p>
  If you create this file and name it <a href="./test.html"><code>test.html</code></a> 
  and load it in your browser, it should
  just display the text, &ldquo;Hello, web browser!&rdquo;.  If you save this file as 
  <code>test.php</code> and load it in your browser again (don't forget 
  to type in the URL with 
  the php at the end!) it will look exactly the same. So what's the big deal?
</p>
<p>
  The big deal is that when the file is saved with the <code>.php</code> at the end, the web server 
  will allow you to write programs inside the page. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
&lt;head>
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://netdenizen.org/webdesign/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />
  &lt;title>Empty PHP File&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
  &lt;p>
    &lt;?php print("Hello, web browser!\n"); ?>
  &lt;/p>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</code></pre>

<p>
  You can see an example of the preceding file <a href="./test.php">with the modification</a>. 
  Notice that instead of just putting the text: <em>Hello, web browser!</em> in the HTML directly
  it is set inside a special pair of tags: <strong><code>&lt;?php</code></strong> and 
  <strong><code>?></code></strong>. The
  text isn't just placed inside, either. It is presented inside a function call: <code>
  print("hello, web browser!");</code>. Now try looking at the source of the page. Does it look 
  like the original example? Where did the extra php tag and print stuff go?
</p>
<p>
  When the web server sees the matching <strong><code>&lt;?php</code></strong> and 
  <strong><code>?></code></strong> tags, it 
  signifies PHP code. The server will execute this code as if it were a computer program and 
  if there are any <code>print</code> function calls, it will emit new text into the file, as if
  it were always there. In this way, the web server can generate a file "on the fly" that looks
  exactly like an HTML file that you created using Textwrangler.
</p>

<h2>Now It's Your Turn</h2>
<p>
  Create your own version of the file <code>test.php</code> and try the following additional
  pieces of code inside the <code>&lt;?php</code> and <code>?></code>:
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;?php
  $greeting = "courageous web design student";
  print ("Hello, $greeting!\n");
?>
</code></pre>

<p>
  Try saving this to your desktop first, and drag it into your web browser. If should display
  all of the ugly PHP code because there was no web <em>server</em> to process the code. Now
  upload it to the web server and load the URL into your browser. It should display a message
  like this:
</p>
<pre><code>Hello, courageous web design student!</code></pre>
<p>
  Note that the <code>\n</code> in the printed string tells the web server to insert a "new line"
  in the text that it emits. This is the same as when you press the return key on your keyboard
  while you are editing an HTML file.
</p>
<p>
  Variables in PHP are always named with a dollar sign at the start (e.g. $greeting). You can
  use these variables inside of quoted strings (like this example), which is a pretty neat trick.
</p>
<p>
  PHP is also very good at doing basic mathematics. Try something like this:
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;?php
  $greeting = "courageous web design student";
  $pi = 3.141592654;
  $diameter = 35.0;
  $area = $pi * pow(($diameter / 2.0),2); /* pow raises one number to the power of another */
  print ("&lt;p>Hello, $greeting!&lt;/p>\n");
  print ("&lt;p>The area of a circle that is $diameter inches across is $area square inches!&lt;/p>\n"); 
?>
</code></pre>

  This was just a super duper quickie intro to PHP scripting. If you would like to learn more, 
  there are many excellent tutorials on the Internet.
