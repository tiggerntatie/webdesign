<h1>Add Intelligence with Javascript</h1>
<p>
  If you follow the advice in the mini-tutorial on 
  <a href="http://www.netdenizen.org/webdesign/minitutorials/forms.html">
  HTML forms</a> and <a href="http://www.netdenizen.org/webdesign/minitutorials/stylingforms.html">
  styling them</a> then you should end up with a reasonably attractive web page form.
</p>
<p>
  The example in the <a href="http://www.netdenizen.org/webdesign/challenge6.html"> Challenge 6
  assignment</a> has a couple of buttons at the end of the page that you use to transfer values
  from the form to the story paragraph. The HTML for those looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;input type='button' value='Show Story' onclick='javascript:challenge6.transferWords("madlibs");' class="input" />
</code></pre>
<p>
  and
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;input type='button' value='Hide Story' onclick='javascript:challenge6.hideStory();' class="input" />
</code></pre>
<p>
  In both cases, the <code>value</code> attribute is used to define the text that appears on the 
  button. The <code>onclick</code> attribute tells your browser what it should do when someone
  clicks on the button.
</p>
<p>
  When someone presses the 'Show Story' button, the browser will activate the Javascript interpreter
  that is built into the web browser and use it to execute a function called 
  <code>challenge6.transferWords</code>, using the argument <code>"madlibs"</code>. If you have
  copied the code I have provided up to this point, you will find that this button doesn't seem
  to do anything at all. Now we will change that!
</p>

<h2>Link in Some Javascript Code</h2>
<p>
  In the beginning you wrote web pages using only HTML. Then you learned how to style the pages
  by linking your HTML document to a CSS document. Now you need to link your HTML document
  to a new kind of document that contains Javascript computer software. To do that, add a line
  like this inside the <code>&lt;head></code> block of your HTML page:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="challenge06.js">&lt;/script>
</code></pre>
<p>
  This will make your web browser load the file <code>challenge06.js</code> alongside the HTML and
  CSS documents. The contents of this Javascript aren't displayed in your browser, and they don't
  have an immediate effect on the appearance of your page.
</p>
<h2>Create your Javascript File</h2>
<p>
  For your <code>challenge06.js</code> you should create a new, empty file in your <code>public</code>
  directory on the server and copy/paste the entire contents of 
  <a href="http://www.netdenizen.org/webdesign/challenge6.js">my Javascript file</a> in to it. Save
  the file to the web server.
</p>

<h2>Tweak your Javascript</h2>
<p>
  Look at your Javascript code. Javascript code is a set of instructions that your web browser can
  follow to do <em>something useful</em>. Most big web pages on the Internet use at least a little
  Javascript to make them more user friendly or powerful. Many of the fancy navigation features
  that you find on the web are created "on the fly" using Javascript. Google's Gmail and Docs 
  sites rely very heavily on Javascript: the pages you see on the screen are defined with HTML but
  Javascript makes them move and react to you. Javascript is a very powerful and fast programming
  language and we could devote an entire semester long course only to learning the basics of writing
  Javascript software. You will learn enough to incorporate existing Javascript code into your
  web page. This is very representative of the way that web designers actually use Javascript in
  their daily work.
</p>
<p>
  In your newly created Javascript file, you will find near the bottom of the file a section that
  looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
  /* transferWords moves the form content to the following paragraph, field by field */
  this.transferWords = function(story_id) {
    this.addWordbyID("first-name", "first-name-dest");
    this.addWordbyID("birthplace", "birthplace-dest");
    this.addWordbyID("birth-month", "birth-month-dest");
    this.addRadioButtonbyName("birth-decade", "birth-decade-dest");
    this.addWordbyID("secret", "secret-dest");
    this.addCheckBoxbyName("leaning", "leaning-dest");
    this.addWordbyID("world-view", "world-view-dest");
    /* display the story */
    this.storyID = story_id;
    document.getElementById(this.storyID).style.display = "block";
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
  This block of Javascript code was written for the sole purpose of transferring data from the
  Challenge 6 assignment example form controls to the "blanks" in the story paragraph that 
  follows it. Since it is written to work only with that web page, you will probably need to 
  modify this piece of Javascript code to make it work on your page.
</p>
<p>
  Most form controls are transferred by executing code like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
this.addWordbyID("first-name", "first-name-dest");
</code></pre>
<p>
  This example transfers the data found in the control with an <code>id="first-name"</code> to 
  a <code>&lt;span></code> element with <code>id="first-name-dest"</code>. Some of the other
  lines transfer data from radio buttons and check boxes, so make sure you use the right type
  of line for each control in your form.
</p>
<p>
  You should rename the ids in your own work to make them more meaningful for your form.
</p>
<p>
  The last line of this code snippet actually changes the CSS <code>display</code> attribute
  for the paragraph to "block", meaning that the paragraph will be displayed as an HTML 
  block. 
</p>  

<h2>What is an ID Anyway?</h2>
<p>
  Up until now you have specified your content by using the <code>class='classname'</code> 
  attribute. Class names can be assigned to as many different elements as you want. On the other
  hand, the <code>id='idname'</code> attribute is used to assign a <em>unique</em> identification
  to a <em>single</em> element in your web page. So the Javascript code examines the HTML
  itself to locate the unique controls, retrieves the control values and transfers them to the 
  <em>unique</em> <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements in the story paragraph.  
</p>
<p>
  If you want to refer to an element with a <code>id="example"</code> in your CSS so it can 
  be styled in a unique way, then you can use the # character before the id. Example:
</p>
<pre><code>
div#madlibs {
  display: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This rule apples to the <strong>One Unique</strong> <code>&lt;div></code> element that is 
  assigned an <code>id="madlibs"</code>.
</p>
  

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
  If you have completed the challenge and have nothing to do (unlikely!) I would recommend 
  Googling around for interesting Javascript code that is freely available and designed to do
  something cool (for example, drop down navigation menus, photo gallery, etc.). You can learn
  a lot by examining code that other people have written and figuring out how to incorporate it in 
  your own web pages.
