<h1>Web Design Reflection 7: Typography</h1>
<p>
  Compare this reflection to the <a href="./reflection6.html">
  last reflection assignment</a>. Do you see any differences in style between this page and the
  previous one? 
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of this reflection is to start you thinking about the choices you make on font 
  size and style. Just as in the last reflection about color theory, there are many people out there
  who will tell you what to do. The good news is that you get to make up your own mind!
</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol class="instructions">
  <li>
    Create a web page in your <code>public</code> folder and name it 
    <code>reflection07.html</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Read this <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/11-typography-on-the-web/"> discussion 
    of typography on the web</a>. (yes, all of it).
  </li>
  <li>
    Please answer the following questions in your page, using complete, spell checked sentences: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        How would you describe the typeface used in the body text of this page, versus the typeface
        used in the last reflection assignment? 
      </li>
      <li>
        How would you describe the typeface used in the title text of this page, versus the 
        typeface used in the title text of the last reflection assignment?
      </li>
      <li>
        If one of the purposes of web design is to communicate ideas and information to your
        visitors then surely the choice of typeface (font) must be very important. Look again at 
        the <a href="./reflection6.html">last reflection
        assignment</a> and then back at this one. Which of these two pages is easier to read 
        from the standpoint of text clarity and readability (as opposed to my tortured syntax and
        writing style)? I am asking here for <strong>your opinion</strong> but you must <strong>
        back up your opinion with an explanation</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In your opinion should web pages strive to resemble print media (magazines and newspapers)?
        Please <strong>back up your opinion with an explanation of why</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Based on what you have read, and your own opinion, how should you decide when to use
        serif or sans-serif fonts on your web page? If you don't know the difference
        between these then go back and 
        <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/11-typography-on-the-web/">do the reading</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Why would you want to specify more than one font in a <code>font-family</code> attribute
        in your CSS?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Your reflection web page should validate (of course!).
  </li>
