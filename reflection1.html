<h1>Web Design Reflection 1: To Validate or Not?</h1>
<p>Think back to your <a href="http://www.netdenizen.com/webdesign/challenge1.html">first challenge
  </a>in this course: among other things, you were asked to identify a website that you admire
  and another site that you do not. Now that you have had a small amount of experience writing
  web pages by hand, you will return to those sites to see if they are valid HTML. Here is what 
  you need to do for this reflection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read <a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html">this page about why it is important
  to validate your html</a></li>
  <li>Visit the website you said you admired. Check it with the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">
  markup validator</a> that you have been using to check your own code. </li>
  <li>Visit the website you said you hated and run it through the validator too.</li>
  <li>Create a new web page on the web server and name it <code>reflection01.html</code>. On this
    new page answer the following questions:
    <ol>
      <li>Did either of the websites validate without errors? If not, how many errors did they 
        have?</li>
      <li>Do you think you should be validating your own web pages, or is it a waste of your time?</li>
      <li>Can you find any other opinions (aside from the page I already asked you to read) on 
      the Internet to support your point of view? Summarize that opinion and <em>provide a link</em>
      to the original source.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't forget:</strong> make sure your reflection validates. Feel free to add the
      <a href="http://netdenizen.org/webdesign/minitutorials/addvalidator.html">validation link/image</a>
      that you added in <a href="http://netdenizen.org/webdesign/challenge3.html">
      Challenge 3</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can research and respond to this reflection as homework and use class time and/or the X
  to compose your answer using TextWrangler. You can also use <a href="http://shiftedit.net">
  shiftedit.net</a> to create and edit the page from home. This reflection is due on the next
  X day.
